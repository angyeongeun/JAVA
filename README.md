Choosing the right algorithm
The data structures and algorithms you use critically affect two factors in your applications:

1. Memory usage (for data structures).
2. CPU time (for algorithms that interact with those data structures).


It follows that you should be especially mindful of the algorithms and data structures you use for applications that will process lots of data. These include applications used for big data and the Internet of Things.
